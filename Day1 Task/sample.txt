 Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
  
  HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol..
          # The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997.
          =>Because it went through several stages of development this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1.
          # This version is still in use on the web. In 2015 a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.
          =>HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate.
          # In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
          => HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other so if one resource cannot be loaded it blocks all the other resources behind it. 
           # HTTP/2 solves this problem by allowing a server to "push" content to a client before the client asks for it.
          => To speed up web performance both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.
